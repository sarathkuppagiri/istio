# Tornado - Demo Websockets App

This is a sample application that demonstrates the use of an upgraded websockets connection on an ingress traffic when using Istio `VirtualService`.
The `app.yaml` creates a Kubernetes `Service` and a `Deployment` that is based on an existing Docker image for [Hiroakis's Tornado Websocket Example](https://github.com/hiroakis/tornado-websocket-example).

__Notice:__ The addition of websockets upgrade support in v1alpha3 routing rules has only been added after the release of `Istio v0.8.0`.

## Prerequisites

Install Istio by following the [Istio Quick Start](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html).

## Installation

1. First install the application service:

    - With automatic sidecar injection

    ```command
    kubectl apply -f app.yaml --namespace demo-istio
    ```

1. Create the Ingress `Gateway` and `VirtualService` that enables the upgrade to Websocket for incoming traffic:

    ```command
    kubectl apply -f route.yaml --namespace demo-istio
    ```

## Determining the ingress IP and ports

```
Execute the following command to determine if your Kubernetes cluster is running in an environment that supports external load balancers:

$ kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)   AGE
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   172.21.109.129   130.211.10.121   ...       17h

If the EXTERNAL-IP value is set, your environment has an external load balancer that you can use for the ingress gateway. If the EXTERNAL-IP value is <none> (or perpetually <pending>), your environment does not provide an external load balancer for the ingress gateway. In this case, you can access the gateway using the serviceâ€™s node port.

If you are using minikube, you can easily start an external load balancer (recommended) by running the following command in a different terminal:

$ minikube tunnel
export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
$ export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].port}')
 export GATEWAY_URL=$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT
 OR
 
export INGRESS_HOST=$(minikube ip)
export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')
export GATEWAY_URL=$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT

## Test

- Access <http://$GATEWAY_URL/> with your browser

- The `WebSocket status` should show a green `open` status which means  that a websocket connection to the server has been established.
To see the websocket in action see the instructions in the _REST API examples_ section of the demo app webpage for updating the server-side data and getting the updated data through the open websocket to the table in the webpage (without refreshing).

## Cleanup

```command
kubectl delete -f route.yaml --namespace demo-istio
kubectl delete -f app.yaml --namespace demo-istio
```
